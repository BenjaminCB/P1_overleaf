\section{Project Management}
To manage our project, we have used several tools. The most prominent of these is Gitlab, since that has been used to keep track of both the development of the program and day to day planning, such as assigning tasks and planning meetings. Essentially, Gitlab has been an indispensable tool, since it has made it much easier for us to keep track of the project files and our progress.
Another useful tool has been Google Drive, since it has been useful for sharing notes, documents, and the data required for our project.


To manage our time and schedule the individual parts of our project, we have made a Gantt-chart in Google Sheets. It has been quite useful, since we always knew which part of the project we should work on. The Gannt-chart helped motivate us since there always was a deadline for each of the parts of our project, albeit an artificial one. Furthermore, it was quite useful when discussing the project with our supervisor, since we could always provide him a detailed plan of our future work on the project.

In conclusion, all the previously mentioned tools have been quite useful for their respective tasks and will most likely be used extensively in future projects.
