\section{Status seminar}
Halfway through the P1-project we had a status seminar. We wanted to be sure our problem proposition was specified enough, and that the problem would be acceptable to solve. Although response from our opponent group was sparse, the feedback from our PBL teacher and supervisor was confirmation that we could continue with the problem proposition and actually begin designing and programming the solution to the scheduling problem of \siemens. There was of course also some suggestions for improvement of the report, which we implemented shortly after the status seminar.
