\section{Group-teamwork}
Our teamwork has been nothing short of great since we all get along in our group. We are good at helping each other when need be, but we are also good at socializing and having fun on a daily basis in our group room. In our group contract, we have written that we must have one daily social activity of approximately 30 minutes, which is meant to strengthen our group bond. This daily activity can consist of anything from playing video games to discussing government funded artists. 
Our overall impression of this daily activity has been nothing but positive, since it has improved our group spirit.

However, the well functioning social dynamic of our group is also our groups Achilles' heel, since we sometimes spend too little time working on the project. One thing that we have done in an attempt to improve ourselves regarding our work morale, is setting daily goals. By doing that we have created a source of motivation for us. This has proven to be quite effective since our group has definitely increased its work morale and focus on the project compared to the days when we did not set any daily goals.
