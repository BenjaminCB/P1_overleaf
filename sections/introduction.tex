\chapter*{Introduction}
In this report we will be documenting the process of our project work. The main focus of our project is work scheduling. We will be working with a real-life case from \siemens. Our aim is to figure out how to automate the process of generating the final schedule, and hopefully saving the company time as a result.

Throughout the problem analysis we will be covering topics such as union agreements, fairness, needs of the interested parties, and the already existing solutions. The analysis of these topics will be of great importance when specifying our program requirements since they must be considered when generating a work schedule \siemens can actually use.

As the last part of this report, we will in detail describe how the program itself works. This will be done through a description of the requirements for the program, the specification and design of the program, as well as the overall structure and implementation of our program and the individual parts.

Our motivation for working with \siemens as our case was that we wanted to work with a real-life case instead of a purely theoretical one.
