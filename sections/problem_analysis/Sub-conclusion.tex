\section{Sub-conclusion for chapter one}
From this problem analysis it can be concluded that there are many different factors to take into account regarding work scheduling. These include different interested parties, who each want to optimize their benefits from the work schedule, and therefore there may be conflict of interests that must be taken into consideration. Union agreements have also proven to be a very important factor, since the work schedule our program creates, would be useless if it violated the union agreements. Also the more abstract term, fairness, should be taken into consideration since it could make the difference between a technically functional schedule and a good schedule.

Since the goal is to create our own program it has been necessary to look at existing solutions and see how they have been trying to solve the previously mentioned problems. From that part we have gained valuable information regarding what we must include, what we could include, as well as what we could improve.

Overall, the problem analysis has been quite useful, since it has given us the necessary information that has been taken into account when working on the solution.
