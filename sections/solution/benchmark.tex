\section{Benchmark}
At last we want to show if our solution will actually be better than the system \siemens currently has. Our solution currently takes less than a second to read the input-file and write the output file. If we take into consideration that a user must also add the different visuals that the workers expect, it takes approximately 4 minutes, which was the time we used in testing. This means that the whole process of creating the work schedule can be done in about 5 minutes. 
Compared to the method that \siemens is currently using that takes about x hours, this method is much faster. Furthermore, this method does not mean you have to know the different requirements of making a schedule, the program does it for you. This means that the learning process of making a work schedule is also shortened to a few minutes.
Our system will also create a work schedule that upholds all the union agreements, meaning that human mistakes are not possible. We have also made a grading system that would be unbiased regarding what days to add or remove, unless humans intervene through the requirements system.
So we can conclude that our solution is a viable improvement to the system currently used at \siemens, as it is both executed much faster and the time learned to master our system will be significantly lower, and much less prone to making mistakes, as it will create the work schedule reliably.
