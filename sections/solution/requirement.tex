\section{Requirements}
In this section we will be outlining the requirements of our program. We will be separating the various requirements by priority. Some of our requirements are significantly more important than others, and the ones of lower priority may not end up being implemented if the available time proves to be insufficient.

Our programs requirements are listed as following (each of the requirements is marked with a number representing its priority):
\begin{itemize}
    \reqItem[1]{Input/Output}{Since we need to import the data from an Excel document, we need to figure how exactly to do this. Since, the Excel format is quite complicated we want to take a simpler approach. As such we want to use a \textit{semicolon separated value} format, which Excel has native export and import support for.}
    
    \item[] \textbf{Union and local agreements:} The program needs be able to create a schedule that upholds the union and local agreements, regarding working hours and shift placement.
    
    \item[] \textbf{SH-days:} The program needs to take holidays (SH-days) into account.
    
    \item[] \textbf{Work hours:} The program should ensure that each of the teams do not exceed the expected hours or have an insufficient amount of hours, and remove or add shifts accordingly. Here public holidays and Saturdays should be prioritized over other days, if a shift is able to be removed.
    
    The program must accumulate the work hours and include them with the resulting schedule.
    
    \reqItem{Days in a year}{Since the year does not start at the same weekday each year we have a different number of weekends each year. Our program should be able to allocate memory according to the number of days, weeks and weekends, in that specific year.}
    
    \item[2] \textbf{Leap years:} The program should be able to change the schedule accordingly if the year is a leap year.
    
    \item[\textbf{3}] \textbf{Schedule criteria:} In the case of a proposed schedule being rejected we would need to generate a new one that can take the needed adjustments into account. In this case we would have to generate a new schedule, and to do that we need to define a format and method by which the end user can supply adjustments to the schedule.
    
    \item[\textbf{4}] \textbf{Option flags:} There can be the option to flag your output file, for example give it a specific name instead of the programmed standard name.
    
    \item[] \textbf{GUI:} The program should have a graphical user interface.
    
    \reqItem[5]{Excel file}{The program should output a more user-friendly file-format like a \texttt{.xml} file instead of a \texttt{.csv} file. It would be more user friendly, as the schedule would be able to add the different colours if needed, as well as generating a better looking layout.}
\end{itemize}
