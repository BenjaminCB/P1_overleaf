\section{Sub-conclusion to chapter two}
There are several factors that we have taken into consideration when developing the solution, since the problem analysis states a multitude of requirements. Firstly, the requirements have been listed after priority to make it easier for us, as well as the reader, to understand which parts of the program are more important. This has proven to be quite useful since we always knew what should be prioritized when creating the program.

The "Specification and design" section has also been of great use to us, since it in detail provided necessary guidelines and information regarding how the program should work. The third section was useful for keeping track of the overall structure of our program. That has been quite important, since we easily could have messed up the management of creating our program. This could have led to improper coordination of the creation process and

The second chapter has made it much easier for us the create the solution since it has provided both overall as well as more detailed guidelines, as well as helped us lay out a plan of how we should create the program.
